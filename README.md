## API practice project

This site is to help me understand what i need to do to use an external data API. I have put some effort into other sites for stylings so kept this site minimal so I could focus on backend tech.

For this I initially chose the IGDB developer API but I soon realized it was not a standard case as they use a unique query language called Apicalypse. 

I wanted the basics down before I jumped into something like that so I chose the popular Open Weather Maps API. 

That was my initial goal and as I have set that up I want to move forward with steps to deployment, my case onto Heroku, and then best practices to version control after deployment.

From there I want to add a MySQL database and populate that with page content and whatever else I decide to add to the site.
